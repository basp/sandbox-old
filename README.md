### sandbox
This is just for messing around with experimental stuff.

### todo
* Built-in function references should not be strings, they should be pointers
into a function table.
* Inject all the services into the `Interpreter`, like objects (including
properties and verbs), tasks, io, utility and other related stuff.
* Lot's of other things to be added later.
